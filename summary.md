# WorkoutPlanViewModel Integration Summary

## Changes Made

1. **Updated the WorkoutPlanViewModel**
   - Modified the constructor to accept `ExerciseDefinitionRepository` and `WorkoutPlanRepository` parameters
   - Implemented logic to load existing workout plans from the repository and update the UI accordingly
   - Enhanced the `parseAndSaveInputText` method to save parsed plans to the repository
   - Added a `clearSavedPlan` method to clear the repository and return to input mode

2. **Updated AppModule for Dependency Injection**
   - Added a provider method for `WorkoutPlanViewModel` that injects the required repositories
   - Fixed import statements to correctly reference the required classes

3. **Updated WorkoutPlanScreen to Use the Injected ViewModel**
   - Modified the `WorkoutPlanScreen` composable to use the injected `WorkoutPlanViewModel` instead of creating one with a factory

## How It Works Now

1. When the app starts, the `WorkoutPlanViewModel` checks if there's a saved workout plan in the `WorkoutPlanRepository`
2. If a plan exists, it displays it in the UI
3. If no plan exists, it shows the text input area for creating a new plan
4. When a user parses a new plan, it is saved to the repository for future use
5. The user can clear the saved plan which will return them to the input mode

## Next Steps

- Consider implementing the WorkoutExecutionViewModel injection when the SavedStateHandle issue is resolved
- Continue enhancing the UI with animations and transitions
- Implement additional features from the todo list
