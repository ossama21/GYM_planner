   - Use the same device for all screenshots
   - Maintain the same screen resolution and aspect ratio

3. **Data Privacy**:
   - Don't include any personal data (real names, email addresses, etc.)
   - Use placeholder data like "John Doe" for user information

4. **Time and Battery**:
   - Set the device time to a reasonable hour (like 9:00 AM)
   - Ensure battery level is above 50% to avoid low battery indicators

5. **Filename Consistency**:
   - Use the exact filenames as listed in this document
   - All filenames should be lowercase with underscores between words
